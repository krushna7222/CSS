    <h1>Web development</h1>
    <div class="outer" id="outer">
      Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the
      Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web
      development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain
      text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social
      network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web
      development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web
      content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting,
      Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

        For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can
        consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard
        methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites.[1] Smaller
        organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting
        developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a
        graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may
        be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of
        a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer
        specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack
        developer.[3] Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and
        visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal
        with the servers.[4] Since the commercialization of the Web, the
        industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies
        ever.
