        <h2>Coffee</h2>
        <p>
          Coffee production begins when the seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits
          (coffee cherries) are separated to produce unroasted green coffee
          beans. The beans are roasted and then ground into fine particles.
          Coffee is brewed from the ground roasted beans, which are typically
          steeped in hot water before being filtered out. It is usually served
          hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Coffee can be prepared
          and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press,
          caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). Sugar, sugar
          substitutes, milk, and cream are often added to mask the bitter taste
          or enhance the flavor. There are also various coffee substitutes.

          The term pizza was first recorded in the year 997 AD, in a Latin

          speciality guaranteed (TSG) dish. In 2017, the art of making
          Neapolitan pizza was added to UNESCO's list of intangible cultural
          heritage.[9]In 2017, the world pizza market was US$128 billion, and in
          the U.S. it was $44 billion spread over 76,000 pizzerias.[13] Overall,

        <h2>Tea</h2>
        <p class="tea">
          Masala chai (/məˈsɑːlə tʃaɪ/; lit. 'mixed-spice tea') is a popular
          beverage throughout South Asia, originating in India. It is made by
          brewing black tea (usually crush, tear, curl) in milk and water, and
          then by sweetening with sugar. Adding aromatic herbs and spices
          creates masala chai, although chai is often prepared unspiced.[2][3]
          Chai is a way of life in India. Almost everywhere you go—in trains, on
          streets, in sari shops—you will see people gulping down the sweet,
          spicy, milky beverage. In America, "chai" has become known as a flavor
          of tea with predominantly cinnamon or cardamom notes. But in India,
          chai is not a flavor of tea; The term chai originated from the Chinese
          word for tea, cha (see Etymology of tea) via the Hindi chai (चाय). In
          English, this spiced tea is commonly referred to as chai tea,[4] or
          simply chai.[5] Originating in India,[1][6] the beverage has gained
          worldwide popularity.
