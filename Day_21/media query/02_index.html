          CSS Media queries are a way to target browser by certain
          characteristics, features, and user preferences, then apply styles or
          run other code based on those things. Perhaps the most common media
          queries in the world are those that target particular viewport ranges
          and apply custom styles, which birthed the whole idea of responsive
          design. There are lots of other things we can target beside viewport
          width. That might be screen resolution, device orientation, operating
          system preference, or even more among a whole bevy of things we can
          query and use to style content.
